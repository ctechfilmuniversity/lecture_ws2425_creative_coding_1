In this session we are dealing with the topic of *asynchronism*, where we encounter it in every day life and what it means for us as humans. In terms of tech, this session introduces you to some web-specific JavaScript functionality and syntax, which we will need in the upcoming sessions.  


## JavaScript Functions & Asynchronism

### Task 04.01

Re-cap the sections in the script regarding higher order functions and their different syntax formats. As a beginner you can skip the more advanced sections that we haven't covered in class:

* [Higher Order Functions](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2425_04_javascript_script.md#higher-order-functions)
* [Anonymous Functions](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2425_04_javascript_script.md#anonymous-functions)
* [Arrow Functions](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2425_04_javascript_script.md#arrow-functions)
* [Asynchronism](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2425_04_javascript_script.md#asynchronism)

At the very least make sure that you understand the underlying functionality and that you will be able to work with the syntax when given to you, e.g., from a framework. 

If you are more advanced, make sure that your understand Closures, Promises and Async and Await.

## Three.js

### Task 04.02 - Your Own Scene

Create a Three.js scene up to your liking. There are no constraints for what the scene should be. The result should be polished and will be graded on concept, form / design and implementation quality.

You are required to use additional functionality that you haven't yet used last week. Check the [three.js manual](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene) or [the examples](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_animation_keyframes) for inspiration.

  
*Submission*: Link in your markdown submission file at least one result image or video of your work. Also, submit the required source files, and your package.json for me to `npm install` and `npm run` your project. If your are using a different environment than npm, let me know which steps to follow and make sure that the required steps to run your project are **easy** and **fast** (any setup that takes more than 5 minutes for me to re-create or need heavy installations, I am most likely not doing).


## Learnings

Please summarize your personal learnings. What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?

*Submission*: Text or bullet points in your markdown submission file.
