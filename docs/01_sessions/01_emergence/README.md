## Introduction

Recapture [Script 01 - Introduction](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2425_01_intro_script.md), if need be.


### Task 01.02

Think a bit about your own personal motivation to learn creative coding. What would you like to do with coding and the topics in this class? What kind of final creative coding project is of interest to you? 

*Bullet points as answer are sufficient.*


### Task 01.03

Find an existing creative coding project that you like. Coding needs to play a significant role for the project, also ideally it is web-based (this is not a hard requirement). Describe what you like about the project and why you think that the project represents creative coding.

Submit a short text and any other material you like (weblinks, images, videos).



## p5

If you are a beginner, you can find detailed and slowly explained information in the scripts of my [*Creative Coding for Beginners Course*](https://ctechfilmuniversity.github.io/lecture_ss23_creative_coding_for_beginners/02_scripts/).

Also, please refer to [p5's reference](https://p5js.org/reference/). It is well-made.


### Task 01.04 - *p5 With The Online Editor*

Create an account for the [p5 online editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) and work with the online editor (we will move on from this environment soon though).  
  
*Tip*: Right-click on the canvas in the p5 editor and chose `Save image as...` to save an image of your canvas.


### Task 01.05 - The 10 PRINT pattern

Write a p5 sketch that generates a pattern with a similar logic as the 10 PRINT example. Your pattern should follow an element-by-element and row-by-row iterative creation process. If you are a beginner, you can use [the code from the slides](https://editor.p5js.org/legie/sketches/nrfQTzxMI) as a basis (fully understand it first, though!). The goal is to create a visual pleasing or interesting pattern. 

If you have further ideas about how to design the pattern but do not manage to implement them, also submit your ideas in text or image form.

*Tip*: Even though this session is only due Dec. 19, we will talk about it in class Dec. 18. I recommend to be done with this task Dec. 18 already.

Submit a link to your sketch and link at least one png preview image of your pattern in your assignments' folder `lastname/01` in your markdown submission file `cc1_ws2425_XX_lastname.md`.
