# Session 05 - Systems (55 points)

Please complete this session by February 28th. Completing the session should take < 40h.  


* [Creative Coding I](#creative-coding-i)
* [Session 05 - Systems (55 points)](#session-05---systems-55-points)
    * [Task 05.01 - The Final Project](#task-0501---the-final-project)
    * [Task 05.02 - Feedback](#task-0502---feedback)
    * [Learnings](#learnings)



Our last topic is *systems*. We are done with the class and hopefully from here on you have enough coding competencies and algorithmic thinking developed that you can build more complex systems - by using code, nodes, hardware... Also, hopefully you, yourself, can further evolve with what you have learned from this class (üêõ -> ü¶ã). 

## Task 05.01 - The Final Project 

The final project is an individually chosen project. 

*Maybe a portfolio page?* üëë  
  
*Maybe something useless?* üòÅ  
  
You can do whatever you want but your project must make use of text-based programming. It can also be an experiment, part of a larger project, work in progress, or a learning path. Ideally it should be something online, but this is not a hard requirement. You don't need to submit a project plan beforehand. However, I am open to discuss your plan with me in advance.  

The time dedicated to the final project is ~40h.

The official work period for the final assignment is Feb. 1st - Feb. 28th. The deadline for the final project is February, 28th.

* The deadline for the final project is strict and for a late submission, I reduce **15% of the total points**.
* If you are sick within the official work period, you can get a deadline extension based on a doctor's note ("Attest"). You must hand in the Attest within 3 days.

As submission, I require

* a description
* the source code
* a link to the build / online deployment or such, and
* at least one representative image.
 
Submit your code in your assignment folder as assignment `05` or add a link there to where to find the code.


## Task 05.02 - Feedback

* How would you rate the difficulty of this class from 1 (far too easy) to 5 (far too difficult)?
* How would you rate the amount of work you had to put into this class so far from 1 (no work at all) to 5 (far too much work)?
* How much did you learn in the class and expanded your skill set, from 1 (I am the same) to 5 (learned a lot)?
* How much did you enjoy working with p5, from 1 (hate it) to 5 (love it)?
* How useful do you consider p5 for you, from 1 (don't need it) to 5 (will use it all the time)?
* How much did you enjoy working with tree.js, from 1 (hate it) to 5 (love it)?
* How useful do you consider tree.js for you, from 1 (don't need it) to 5 (will use it all the time)?
* How much did you enjoy working with React, from 1 (hate it) to 5 (love it)?
* How useful do you consider React for you, from 1 (don't need it) to 5 (will use it all the time)?
* How much did you enjoy working on the exercise tasks, from 1 (hated it) to 5 (loved it)?
* What do you think about the context expansions, e.g., the brief general discussions of certain topics?
* Which one was your favorite topic, which one your least favorite?
* Was there a topic missing and if so which one?
* Please feel free to add any feedback you want to give!
