In this session we are dealing with the topic of _space_ and what types of virtual spaces we are working with. In terms of tech, this session introduces you to the JavaScript library [`Threejs`](https://threejs.org/), which is a good choice if you want to build 3D scenes in a browser.

## Local Installation

### Task 03.01 - Your First Scene

* [Install node, nvm and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
* Verify a correct installation with executing `node -v` and `npm -v` in the terminal

*Submission:* -

## three.js

### Task 03.02 - Local Project Setup

Task 03.02 should be developed with a proper local installation. For that you can follow these steps in a terminal:

* Create a project folder
    * Either manually or in the terminal with `mkdir foldername`
* With the terminal navigate into the folder you just created and execute:
    * `npm init -y`
    * `npm install three vite`
* In `package.json` add line `"dev": "vite",` by changing the `"scripts": {...}` entry to:

```
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
```
* Create a `index.html` and a `scene.js`
* Add to `index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Hello three.js!</title>
    <style>
        body { margin: 0; }
    </style>
  </head>

  <body>
    <canvas id="canvasThree"></canvas>
    <script type="module" src="scene.js"></script> 
  </body>
</html>
```
* Complete `Task 03.03` in `scene.js`

### Task 03.03 - Your First Scene

Build a three dimensional, geometric scene. With geometric I mean that the scene should focus on abstract geometry - also think *sculptural*. Remember: exceptional creativity often emerges out of constraints. You could (but don't have to) find inspiration in the following art work.

For this task there is no need to go beyond the three.js basic elements that we have discussed in class. The scene should be navigable with (e.g., a simple orbit control but feel free to do something different) but other than that the scene should not include any interactions.

*Note:* If you have previous experience with three.js and consider yourself a proficent programmer, I expect you to still challenge yourself technically with this exercise as well as completing a polished result.
  

*Submission*: Link in your markdown submission file at least one result image or video of your work. Aslo, submit the required source files, and your package.json for me to `npm install` and `npm run` your project. If your are using a different environment than npm, let me know which steps to follow and make sure that the required steps to run your project are **easy** and **fast** (any setup that takes more than 5 minutes for me to re-create or need heavy installations, I am most likely not doing).


## Learnings

Please summarize your personal learnings. What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?

*Submission*: Text or bullet points in your markdown submission file.
