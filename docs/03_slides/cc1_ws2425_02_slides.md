## Emergence

--

> In philosophy, systems theory, science, and art, emergence occurs when a complex entity has properties or behaviors that its parts do not have on their own, and emerge only when they interact in a wider whole. 
  
<br >
> The remarkable simplicity of complexity...



.footnote[[Wikipedia. 2023. [*Emergence*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence). | A. Martin and K. Helmerson. 2014. [*Emergence: the remarkable simplicity of complexity*](https://theconversation.com/emergence-the-remarkable-simplicity-of-complexity-30973). The Conversation.]]

.task[COMMENT:]  

* For instance, the phenomenon of life as studied in biology is an emergent property of chemistry.
* In philosophy: An emergent property of a system, in this context, is one that is not a property of any component of that system, but is still a feature of the system as a whole. Nicolai Hartmann (1882–1950), one of the first modern philosophers to write on emergence, termed this a categorial novum (new category).

.task[COMMENT:]  

* In the original 72-hour pe- riod, 16.4 million tiles were placed. In 2022, that number increased almost 10x, to 160.4 million tiles (Fig. 3).
At its peak, the 2017 experiment saw nearly 128k active hourly participants (placed at least 1 tile during an hour). In 2022, that number grew to 1.7 million participants an hour (Fig. 4).

.task[COMMENT:]  

* This collaborative composi- tion of flags, memes, icons, logos and recreations of famous paint- ings seemed like a snapshot of collective internet culture in 2017 [Lor]. The rules of the experiment were simple: during the 3-day event, anyone with an anonymous Reddit account could place a single, colored pixel on the canvas every 5 minutes [sim], even on previously colored pixels. At times, the engineering team extended the cooldown period to 20 minutes to mitigate technical issues on the backend [sim]. Users were given a palette of 16 colors from which to choose.

.task[COMMENT:]  

* On several Subreddits, or interest-based subforums on Reddit, groups of users began to co- ordinate and construct larger artworks. Given a 5-minute cooldown period, a single user could at most place an artwork of only 864 pixels, or 36 x 24 pixels, which forced users to collaborate to create any larger artifacts. When Reddit locked the ability to place tiles around hour 72, the resulting artwork was frozen in place, locking in the last pixel that had been placed (Fig. 2).

### Instructions (top down) vs. Emergence (bottom up)


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* We examined in detail one visual artifact (Mona Lisa painting with the Swiss flag) and its related discussion board and suggest a conceptual framework for the analysis of the evolution. The framework takes inspiration from two metaphors of human intervention in natural evolution (plant growth and a disturbed anthill). At the end, we apply the framework to other objects on the canvas and discuss the tradeoff between instruction and emergence.

* The overall logic to create a checkerboard is to fill every other cell black and to shift that every other row. 

* You could also say that in the even rows (meaning the 0., 2., 4. row...), the even columns (meaning the 0., 2., 4. column...) should be black, and in the uneven rows, the uneven cells should be black.

* You can identify even numbers with the modulo operator.

## The Modulo Operator

--

The [modulo](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/m/modulo.htm) operator returns for a division with a whole number the rest of that division:

```js
// Pseudo Code

5 / 2 is 2 (the quotient) with rest 1
7 / 5 is 1 with rest 2

x / y is quotient q with rest r
x = q * y + r
```

---
.header[Tools and Environments | Programming Languages | Programming]

if (number % 2 == 0) 
{
    print("even");
}
```

## Frameworks

--

> A software framework is a universal, reusable software environment that provides particular functionality as part of a larger software platform to facilitate development of software applications, products and solutions.

--

* A special case of software library
* Abstractions of code wrapped in a well-defined Application Programming Interface (API)


.footnote[[[Wikipedia: Software Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework), [Stack Overflow: What is a software framework](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2964140/what-is-a-software-framework)]]


???
* Contain some key distinguishing features

Analogy
* A library is like a toolbox where you pick and use the tools you need.
* A framework is like a template or structure for a house; you build your application around its blueprint.

In short, a library gives you tools to use as you choose, while a framework provides a structure within which you work and defines much of the flow of your application.




A library performs specific, well-defined operations.

A framework is a skeleton where the application defines the "meat" of the operation by filling out the skeleton. The skeleton still has code to link up the parts but the most important work is done by the application.

Examples of libraries: Network protocols, compression, image manipulation, string utilities, regular expression evaluation, math. Operations are self-contained.

Examples of frameworks: Web application system, Plug-in manager, GUI system. The framework defines the concept but the application defines the fundamental functionality that end-users care about.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/148747/what-is-the-difference-between-a-framework-and-a-library



* A library is essentially a set of functions that you can call, these days usually organized into classes. Each call does some work and returns control to the client.
* A framework embodies some abstract design, with more behavior built in. In order to use it you need to insert your behavior into various places in the framework either by subclassing or by plugging in your own classes. The framework's code then calls your code at these points.

## Processing & p5

* [p5](https://p5js.org/) is a library for JavaScript
    * You write JavaScript code but you have additional commands from p5
* p5 is based on the Java framework Processing
    * Processing came first
    * p5 is Processing running in a webbrowser
    * p5 and Processing are very similar



???




Processing

* 2001 developed in the research group Aesthetics and Computation of the Technology Media Labs at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by the students Ben Fry and Casey Reas.
* 2012 the Processing Foundation (a non-profit corporation) was established


>Our mission is to promote software literacy within the visual arts, and visual literacy within technology-related fields — and to make these fields accessible to diverse communities. Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.

???

* Processing came first and still a bit better documented but to me it feels like as if the Processing Foundation is moving away from Processing and solely focus on p5 now. In this class we will only work with p5. You should chose between using Processing and p5 depending on the type of project, you are doing.

* When is it more suitable to use Processing, when p5?
* Who has worked with Processing before?

## Libraries

* p5 extends JavaScript
* Additional libraries extend p5, e.g., for sound

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* The same way p5 is written to extend the base functionality of JavaScript, we can write code that further extends p5.  


* A library is code in regard to a certain topic, e.g. sound, that is somewhat generalized and of use in various contexts.
* Libraries should be compact and also as small as possible. That is one of the reasons why additional libraries are not simply added to p5 itself. 
 
--
* Written by different people


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* Libraries are mostly written by other people or teams and it is easier to manage to keep the development of an additional library separated.

    * Markdown is a popular markup language that converts text to html.
    * Markdown allows you to use an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then converts it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).
    * Github can render markdown. Be aware though that there are different markdown parser ("converter") and what you can do e.g. with a Visual Studio Code plugin for setting and displaying formulas might not be the same as what GitHub can display.

* Work on files...
* `Add` the files that you want to commit to the stage
* `Commit` the staged files to the repository
* Work on files...


    * How do you work with GitHub

#### Pull

When your local repository is connected to an online one on GitHub, you *pull* the recent version from the online repository into your local one.

* https://www.ecosia.org/images?q=lewitt%20Wall%20Drawing%20%23122,&addon=firefox&addonversion=4.1.0
* Solomon "Sol" LeWitt (September 9, 1928 – April 8, 2007) was an American artist linked to various movements, including conceptual art and minimalism.[1] 
* In Wall Drawing #122, first installed in 1972 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, the work contains "all combinations of two lines crossing, placed at random, using arcs from corners and sides, straight, not straight and broken lines" resulting in 150 unique pairings that unfold on the gallery walls. LeWitt further expanded on this theme, creating variations such as Wall Drawing #260 at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, which systematically runs through all possible two-part combinations of arcs and lines.[23] Conceived in 1995, Wall Drawing #792: Black rectangles and squares underscores LeWitt's early interest in the intersections between art and architecture. Spanning the two floors of the Barbara Gladstone Gallery, Brussels, this work consists of varying combinations of black rectangles, creating an irregular grid-like pattern.[24]
