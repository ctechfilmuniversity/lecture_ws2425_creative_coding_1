# Routing

---
.header[React]

## Routing

Routing is the process of determining which content to display based on the URL in a web application. 

--

> This can be understood as page navigation.

--

Ideally navigation happens without needing a full page reload!

.footnote[[ChatGPT 4o: What is routing?]]

---
.header[React]

## Routing

* Library: e.g., `npm install react-router-dom`

--

* Framework: e.g., [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)


???

react-router-dom: Handles client-side routing for Single Page Applications (SPAs) in React.  
  
Next.js: A full-fledged React framework with server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes.
  
Choose react-router-dom if:
* You’re building a simple SPA.
* You only need client-side rendering (CSR).
* SEO is not a major concern.

Choose Next.js if:
* You need better SEO (SSR/SSG).
* You want faster performance with pre-rendering.
* You need backend functionality inside the same project.

---
.header[React]

## Routing

* Library: e.g., `npm install react-router-dom`


* Framework: e.g., [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)


<br />

Approach:

--
1. Define the routes for the application

--
2. Enclose the `App` in a router object

--
3. Set links

            <Navigation />
            <Outlet /> {/* Renders child routes here */}
        </>
    );
};

export default App;
```


???
The <Outlet /> component is used in React Router to render child routes inside a parent route. It acts as a placeholder where nested route components will be displayed.

  
When using nested routes, <Outlet /> tells React Router where to render the child component inside the parent.
Without <Outlet />, child routes wouldn’t appear inside their parent.


---
.header[React]

## Routing

In summary, routing is the process of determining which UI component to display based on the URL.

--

`react-router-dom` is a library that enables client-side routing in React, allowing navigation without full page reloads.

--
* Declarative routing

--
* Navigation with `<Link>`

--
* Nested routes with `<Outlet />`

--
* Supports dynamic routing (`/projects/:id`)

--
* Supports browser history



---
.header[React]

## Properties

--

* Arguments passed into React components
* Passed to components via HTML attributes


---
.header[React | Properties]

Add an attribute of your choice to the `HeroText` element:

```jsx
// Header.jsx
import "./Header.css";
import HeroText from "./HeroText.js";
import HeroImage from "./HeroImage.js";

export default function Header() {
  return (

        <HeroText name="Justus" /> {/* Property name with value Justus */}
        <HeroImage />
  );
}

```




---
.header[React]


Use the `name` attribute in the component with a function argument:

```jsx
// HeroText.jsx

function HeroText(props) {
  return <h2>Hi { props.name }, I am a Hero Text!</h2>;
}
```


.footnote[[[w3schools]](https://www.w3schools.com/react/default.asp)]


---
.header[React]

```jsx
// Header.jsx
import HeroText from "./HeroText.js";

//...
export default function Header() {
  return (

        <HeroText name="Justus" /> 
        <HeroImage />

  );
}
```

```jsx
// HeroText.jsx

function HeroText(props) {
    return <h2>Hi { props.name }, I am a Hero Text!</h2>;
}
```

### React

# Hooks


---
.header[React]

## Hooks

Hooks are special functions that let you “hook into” React’s built-in features inside functional components.

--
* `useState`: Lets a component remember values (a state)  

???
* The fuel gauge of a car
* Like a notebook where you write a number and can update it later.

--
* `useEffect`: Runs code when something changes, runs side effects (e.g., fetching data)


???
* A speed tracker
* Like an alarm clock that goes off when it’s time to wake up.

--
* `useRef`: Keeps a reference to something


???
* A rear-view mirror (references: useRef)
* Like a bookmark in a book—you can jump to that place later.

--
* `useContext`: Shares values between components


???

* Like a WiFi signal that multiple devices (components) can use.

.footnote[[ChatGPT 4o: What are React hooks?]]


???
* Car: component

--

> Different hooks trigger page re-renderings differently.


???
* useState triggers a re-render.
* With useRef, values persist across renders but do not cause extra renders.

---
.header[React]

## `useState` Hook

--
`useState` allows components to have state, i.e., data that can change and trigger re-renders.
  
--
1. Declare a state variable and set an initial value  
  
--
2. Provide a function to update the state (which triggers a re-render)  
  

  

---
.header[React]

## `useState` Hook


```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

export default function Counter() {

    // Declare state variable, 
    // its update function and 
    // a initial value
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0); 

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Count: {count}</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase</button>
        </div>
    );
}
```


???

Explanation  
* const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    * count → State variable (initially 0).
    * setCount → Function to update count.
    * useState(0) → Initializes count with 0.
* Clicking the button calls setCount(count + 1), updating count and re-rendering the component.


---
.header[React]

## `useRef` Hook

--

`useRef` creates a mutable reference that does not trigger re-renders when updated. 

--

* Accessing and modifying DOM elements
* Storing values that persist across renders without causing re-renders

---
.header[React]

## `useRef` Hook

```jsx
import React, { useRef } from "react";

export default function InputFocus() {
    const inputRef = useRef(null); // Create a reference

    const handleClick = () => {
        inputRef.current.focus(); // Directly focus the input field
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <input ref={inputRef} type="text" />
            <button onClick={handleClick}> Focus Input</button>
        </div>
    );
}
```

???
* inputRef.current refers to the actual `<input>` DOM element.
* Clicking the button directly focuses the input using .focus().

```jsx
import React, { useRef, useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
    const countRef = useRef(0); // Mutable reference
    const [renderCount, setRenderCount] = useState(0);

    const increase = () => {
        countRef.current += 1; // Updates value but does NOT trigger re-render
        console.log("Ref Value:", countRef.current);
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Component rendered: {renderCount} times</p>
            <button onClick={() => setRenderCount(renderCount + 1)}>Re-render</button>
            <button onClick={increase}>Increase Ref Count</button>
        </div>
    );
}
export default Counter;
```

countRef.current stores a value that persists across renders but does not trigger re-renders when updated.  
  
Key Points  
  
* Does not trigger re-renders when updated.
* Used for accessing/manipulating DOM elements.
* Great for persisting values between renders (like timers, previous values).

---
.header[React]

## `useEffect` Hook

`useEffect` is used to perform side effects in components, such as:

* Fetching data
* Managing timers

By default, it runs after the component renders but it can be controlled when to run: 

--

```
useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Component re-rendered!"); // Runs after every render
});
```

---

---
.header[React]

## `useEffect` Hook

`useEffect` is used to perform side effects in components, such as:

* Fetching data
* Managing timers

By default, it runs after the component renders but it can be controlled when to run: 

```
useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Component re-rendered!"); // Runs after every render
}, [stateX]);
```

---
.header[React]

## `useEffect` Hook

  
```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

export default function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    useEffect(() => {
        console.log("Component re-rendered!"); // Runs after every render
    });

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Count: {count}</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase</button>
        </div>
    );
}

```
  
useEffect(() => { ... }) runs after every render (default behavior).  



---
.header[React | `useEffect` Hook]

## Controlling `useEffect` Runs

`useEffect` takes a dependency array to control execution.

<br />

#### 1. Run After Each Re-rendering   
```js
useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Component re-rendered!");
}); // NO dependency array → Runs after each update
```
Useful for running code that depends on any state change.   
  

---
.header[React | `useEffect` Hook]

## Controlling `useEffect` Runs

`useEffect` takes a dependency array to control execution.

<br />
  
####  2. Run Only Once (On Mount)  
```js
useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Component mounted!");
}, []); // Empty dependency array → Runs only once
```
Useful for fetching data or setting up event listeners.   
  


---
.header[React | `useEffect` Hook]

## Controlling `useEffect` Runs

`useEffect` takes a dependency array to control execution.

<br />

#### 3. Run When a State Changes  
```js
useEffect(() => {
  console.log(`Count changed: ${count}`);
}, [count]); // Runs only when `count` changes
```
Runs only when `count` updates.  

---
.header[React | `useEffect` Hook]

## Controlling `useEffect` Runs

`useEffect` takes a dependency array to control execution.

<br />
  
#### 4. Cleanup Effect (Before Unmount)  
```js
useEffect(() => {
    const intervalID = setInterval(() => {
        console.log("Timer running...");
    }, 1000);

    return () => clearInterval(intervalID); // Cleanup when unmounted
}, []);
```

Calls the return function once.

???

Built-in JavaScript functions:  
* setInterval starts a repeating function every X milliseconds and returns an interval ID (a number).
* clearInterval(intervalID) stops the interval when it’s no longer needed.

Cleans up when the component unmounts (useful for removing listeners/timers).  
  
Key Points  
* Runs after renders but can be controlled with dependencies.
* Used for fetching data, event listeners, timers, etc.
* Supports cleanup to prevent memory leaks.




---
.header[React]

## Hooks

In summary, React Hooks are functions that let you use state and lifecycle features within components.

--

* Manage states
* Handle side effects and processes
* Create references without causing re-renders


???
Key Rules of Hooks
* Only call hooks at the top level (not inside loops, conditions, or nested functions)
* Only call hooks in React functions (functional components or custom hooks)

# React Three Fiber


---
.header[React]

## React Three Fiber (R3F)

--
* React 3D library for rendering with Three.js

> R3F wraps its own code around Three.js and manages Three.js.


???

A React renderer is a library that allows React to render content to a specific platform beyond the standard DOM. React itself provides the Reconciler, which determines how components should update, but the actual rendering is handled by a renderer.



---
.header[React]

## React Three Fiber

```js
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ color: "blue" });
const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(cube);
```

--

```html
<Canvas>
    <mesh>
        <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
        <meshStandardMaterial color="blue" />
    </mesh>
</Canvas>
```

---
.header[React]

## React Three Fiber

* `<mesh>`  
  → `new THREE.Mesh()`  
* `<boxGeometry />`  
  → `new THREE.BoxGeometry()`  
* `<meshStandardMaterial color="blue" />`  
  → `new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ color: "blue" })`  





---
.header[React | React Three Fiber]
```js
// RotatingCube.jsx
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber';
import { useFrame } from '@react-three/fiber';
import { useRef } from 'react';

function RotatingCube() {
    const meshRef = useRef();

    useFrame(() => {
        meshRef.current.rotation.x += 0.01;
        meshRef.current.rotation.y += 0.01;
    });

    return (
        <mesh ref={meshRef}>
            <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
            <meshStandardMaterial color="blue" />
        </mesh>
    );
}
```


???
* `<Canvas>` → The main 3D scene container (like `<canvas>` in HTML).
* `<mesh>` → A 3D object (in this case, a cube).
* `<boxGeometry>` → Defines the shape of the cube.
* `<meshStandardMaterial>` → Gives the cube color and lighting properties.
* useFrame() → Runs on every frame (used to rotate the cube).

---
.header[React | React Three Fiber]
```js
// App.jsx
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber';
import RotatingCube from "./RotatingCube.jsx";

function App() {
  return (
    <Canvas>
      <ambientLight />
      <RotatingCube />
    </Canvas>
  );
}
export default App;
```


???

* Reacts to State & Props → Easily make 3D objects interactive.
* Leverages React’s Ecosystem → Works with hooks, context, and effects.
* Optimized for Performance → Uses declarative components instead of imperative Three.js code.

---
## React Three Fiber

```
npm install three @react-three/fiber
```


--
* Use JSX to define 3D scenes instead of Three.js code

--
* Treat 3D objects as reusable React components

--
* Use React state and hooks for managing 3D elements


???
* `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef` 

--
* Additional useful hooks, e.g. `useFrame` (for animations) and `useThree` (for scene access)
