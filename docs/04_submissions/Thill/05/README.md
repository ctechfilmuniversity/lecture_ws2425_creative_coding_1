# Singing Demons – R3F Prototype

This project is a recreation of my original Singing Demons concept, which I initially built using plain Three.js. My goal was to adapt and refine it within the React Three Fiber (R3F) ecosystem, leveraging its component-based structure and enhanced workflow.

Throughout the process, I encountered numerous challenges, particularly in translating Three.js logic into R3F conventions. Managing animations, interactivity, and audio integration in this new framework proved to be a learning curve. Despite the obstacles, I was able to implement key features such as demon rows reacting to user input, dynamic colour blending, and interactive sound elements.

While this prototype remains a work in progress, it has provided valuable insights into R3F’s capabilities and limitations. Moving forward, I aim to refine interactivity, optimise performance, and explore additional features to bring the Singing Demons concept to life in a more immersive way.
