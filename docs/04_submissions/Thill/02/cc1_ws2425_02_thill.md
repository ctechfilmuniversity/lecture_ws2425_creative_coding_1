## Task 02.03 - _Algorithmic Thinking_

I struggled to come up with well thought out algorithms. I also lost a lot of time trying to figure out how to run two separate p5js scripts in a single html file. And the solution I found was very cumbersome and made me lose even more time integrating it. 

For 'Circles' I was inspired by a [video about the Fourier series by the coding train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mm2eYfj0SgA&t=799s). As I started to build it and map the speed of rotation, I noticed that there was an emergence happening as the speed of rotation interfered with the frame rate. At certain frame rates, the moving circle seemed to create a new, distinct static shape. In that sense, this design is more in line with the themes of the previous class, but I think it is not wrong to say that this is also a simple algorithm. 

For 'Happiness' I tried to learn more about classes and what they are for. I also used my new knowledge of rotation to create these round flower patterns. With a little more time, I would have tried to make them rotate continuously. This algorithm is not particularly interesting either, but I leaned more towards a systematic approach with it. It definitely helped me to learn some new tricks. 
## Task 02.04 - _Creative Instructions_

-- Achilles heel
Listen to your favourite music and identify what it has in common with the gravest threats to your sanity. Hold on to these thoughts and bathe in the beauty of their deception. Armour yourself with your fresh Achilles heel or sell it on Ebay.

-- Stay
Observe your surroundings. Find an anti-entropic field and walk through it. Redo all your mistakes and add some more. Stop halfway and stay. Devour every word you have ever sung. 

-- Love
Engage in wild behaviour. Emanate destructive force and tear down every glimpse of retribution. At the first sight of love, deteriorate in self pity and finish your homework.
## Learnings

I have to admit that the creative instructions were a lot of fun to make and if I had more time I would have made more of them. As for the p5js scripts, I have to say that instancing is a very annoying solution. Other than that, I really enjoyed creating the visuals. My main take-aways are: Learning about classes and using variables passed directly from functions for the first time.
