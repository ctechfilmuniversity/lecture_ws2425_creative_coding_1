##### Learnings

I started by completing the first 10 episodes of Chapter 01 from Bruno Simon's online course. I used the episode on the Debug UI as a foundation to build the scene. Through this process, I gained a solid understanding of the topics covered up to that point. For this specific example, I delved deeper into working with Matcap textures, exploring their application and how to integrate them effectively into my project.
