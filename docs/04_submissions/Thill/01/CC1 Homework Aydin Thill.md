### Task 01.02

I have always been a little afraid of pure creative coding and have therefore not tried it. I also doubted for a long time that it's use cases could encompass projects to my liking. But with my recent waning interest in basic 3D for video production, I began to wonder how I could create more interactive projects. I thought that some form of creative coding might be useful to achieve this. After the first lesson, I'd like to learn the basics of p5js as quickly as possible to really get a feel for the level of difficulty. I would also like to find out if some of my 3D skills can help me when working with web-based 3D environments.  

### Task 01.03

https://exoportal.xyz/index

This website is a project by the electronic music artist Iglooghost. The design is inspired by early internet aesthetics, immersing users in a fictional world full of hidden easter eggs and hints about upcoming music releases.

I love how the site blends music, visuals, and storytelling. It feels like an interactive extension of Iglooghost’s artistic vision. That said, I think more interactive features could enhance the experience even further.

This has inspired me to consider creating a similar website for my CC1 homework, but with a stronger focus on interaction.

### Task 01.05 - The 10 PRINT pattern

Here are the links to two separate experiments that I have carried out, both of which were inspired by the 10Print algorithm:
