### Task 04.02 - Coding Practices

- I use Chat-GPT mainly to explain code I don't understand. It is perfect for this use case because I can ask as many mean (stupid) questions as I need to and it doesn't get tired of it.

-  When I manage to code something useful, I ask Chat-GPT to recreate the same thing, but in an optimised way. This has been a great way for me to learn new things.

- When I am really struggling to get something done, I ask it to give me some code. Sometimes it works great, sometimes it fails miserably. When I get something useful, I try to understand exactly what it has given me, and if it contains a valuable learning point, I try to recreate it myself. I have done this several times with multiple iterations until I got it right. Sometimes I understand the provided code immediately, sometimes I have to ask Chat-GPT for exact explanations.  I also often check the three.js and javascript documentation to find out more about the new learning points.

- So far I have completed about 24 hours of Bruno Simon's tutorials. It is a great help. I would say that Chat-GPT is a great complementary way to learn and it has helped me to revisit some things that I remembered from the tutorials but could not quite recreate without looking at the videos again.

- One of my biggest difficulties at the moment is that I still struggle to keep track of the code, especially as it gets bigger and more interlinked. But I feel like I am slowly but surely mentally adapting. So I will continue more or less as before.

### Task 04.03 - Your Own Scene

Instructions for when the three.js scene is open:

*You will have the following controls:*

- While pressing the mouse, you will hear a melody originating from the mouse position.
- Pressing the A key will make the creatures sing.
- Your mouse position determines which creatures sing and where the sound comes from.

Challenges and learning-points:

- Maintaining a mental structural overview of the code
- Optimising code and files
- Working with sound and 3D-models
- Work-life balance
