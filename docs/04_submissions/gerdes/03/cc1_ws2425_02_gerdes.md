### Task 03.02

As I am trying to familiarize myself more with React and have used Three.js in the [past](https://github.com/whatphilipcodes/inter/tree/master/src_frontend/three), I saw the opportunity to get started with [R3F](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber). React Three Fiber acts as a React renderer for Three.js and allows for a component-based approach to creating 3D scenes.

Because of that my project file differs from the task suggestion. Since it is still bundled using Vite all commands should work as expected:

`cd` into `.code/03-03/`

```bash
pnpm i && pnpm dev
```

### Task 03.03

> My First React Fiber Scene

### Learnings

- Setup and Configuration of React Three Fiber -> [Template Repository](https://github.com/whatphilipcodes/three-init)
- Migration to Tailwind 4.0
- Familiarization with R3F components
