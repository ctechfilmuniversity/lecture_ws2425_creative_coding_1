# Task 01.02

## Question

_Think a bit about your own personal motivation to learn creative coding. What would you like to do with coding and the topics in this class? What kind of final creative coding project are you envisioning after the first session?_

## Answer  

As I'm already executing my term project with p5.js, I want to properly learn the language and the fundamentals of object-oriented programming, rather than onyl with YouTube tutorials and coding autopilot tools. After gaining some experience with p5.js, I'd like to explore other programming languages at least on a basic level.  
For my project in this class, I plan to write a visual novel video game. I already have short stories for its script and the ability to generate artwork, compose music, and design its sound world. As a creative coding project for this term, building a simple "engine" for the game would be an excellent way to improve my coding skills, while crafting a solid project.

### Task 01.03

**Question**  
_Find an existing creative coding project that you like. Coding needs to play a significant role for the project, also ideally it is web-based (this is not a hard requirement). Describe what you like about the project and why you think that the project represents creative coding._

**Answer**

[Orchestrate](https://gamesforcrows.itch.io/orchestrate)  
An extremely minimal web-based game implementing source managing and user created sound design.

[A Neural Network Hallucinating Over the Bible](https://owncloud.gwdg.de/index.php/s/XlzEcrnSUk2iKXW)  
The text is the input to generate the visuals, and the audio is a mix between text to speech and autoencoder-based processing of gregorian chants.  
https://github.com/lucidrains/big-sleep  

The first project, Orchestrate, is likely a great example of what I aim to achieve this term. Finding a simple yet engaging idea and writing the algorithm, while enhancing it with a visual or auditory touch to make it more interesting, is an amazing combination to develop.  

The second one, A Neural Network Hallucinating Over the Bible, is also an incredible example of integrating text-based generating with sound and visuals. It produces an eerie result, dwelling in the valley of the uncanny almost, to perfectly depict the ambiguity of the Bible's fictive narrative.


### Task 01.05 - The 10 PRINT pattern

[The Pattern](https://editor.p5js.org/irugaru/full/YNtqqbouL)

I modified the pattern exmaple provided to make a tiny animation that finalizes in about 10 seconds.

### Task 01.06 - Greeting Card

[8-bit Scream Simulator](https://editor.p5js.org/irugaru/full/B6b36ie0X)

I created an 8-bit screaming simulator, which uses the webcam input to track your face data, and then when mouth parameters widened, it manipulates the oscialltor to give high pitched, scream-like frequencies.

## Learnings

With both assignments I've learned very basic notions, which could be done inside p5js.

First assignment helped me to understand what can be coded purely graphical. Not the assignment code written but also researching about visual coding.

Secondly, as my term project also implements a gesture-based instrument principle, I learned the details of machinelearning-written recognition algorithms.
And also instead of connecting my p5js code to MAX or a similar software, I found out that it's much simpler to generate waves inside the p5js itself. With external libraries but not necessarily external wave files or softwares.
