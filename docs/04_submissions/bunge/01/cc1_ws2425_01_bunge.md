### Task 01.02

**Question** <br>
*Think a bit about your own personal motivation to learn creative coding. What would you like to do with coding and the topics in this class? What kind of final creative coding project are you envisioning after the first session?*

**Answer** <br>
I have had some moments working on past projects where I get stuck. Usually, this happens when I cannot reach the intended outcome because of program restrictions or a lack of coding knowledge. These moments of frustration often feel like hitting an invisible wall, where my creative vision clashes with the technical limitations of the tools I use.
A first idea that came to my mind was to combine coding/creative coding into the process of designing, preferably in an early stage. This is not a set idea yet, more of a first thought into what I would like to have as a project in this course. I got inspired by [Patrik Hübner](https://www.patrik-huebner.com/about/) who works in the field of generative design combined with creative coding to reach new ways of designing, especially in the design field of brand identities. In essence, he takes data that is directly related to the product, e.g. a wine bottle design the weather takes a crucial role, he then takes this data and visualizes it in the etickette. 
I have been thinking since Lena mentioned she would be glad if someone could approach the design of Ctech, which right now looks like a Pantone bookcover, I have had some ideas in mind. Nevertheless, it seems not enough or quite difficult to represent such a (in my opinion) complex, multilateral study. Just having some cool techy symbols and just approaching it from a design perspective seems not fitting. Maybe, the combination of Data, Coding, and visual representation of it, is the key. 
So what could be these data inputs? GitHub Repository activity, amount of students in each year (baby, elderlies, zombies), real-time data input from students (such as colors, words, images), students' daily mood inputs, cultural backgrounds, etc etc. 

However, I have to give it more thought but it's a start I guess. :)

### Task 01.03

**Question** <br>
*Find an existing creative coding project that you like. Coding needs to play a significant role for the project, also ideally it is web-based (this is not a hard requirement). Describe what you like about the project and why you think that the project represents creative coding.*

**Answer** <br>
There is this really cool portfolio from [Bruno Simon](https://bruno-simon.com) from which I actually was inspired for my own (now old) portfolio. This is one good example of what I mentioned in the first task about how my skillset reached an imaginary wall and couldn't go further to reach what I actually had in mind. However, this portfolio is in my opinion brilliant. I enjoyed so much interacting and seeing new features and just playing around so much that I stayed for way too much time in this website. What makes it fitting as a creative coding example is, that it takes many levels into account. From one side it is visually pleasing, but also user friendly, it's funny, the interaction is understandable, and of course the gamification aspect. By taking all these into account it's what it takes the step to creative coding. It's not just simply to make it work but it's going further and taking other factors into account which are crucial for the user.

## Learnings

Both tasks were equally challenging on their own. I started with the greeting card task and everything went well until I reached two interactions and had to go above (by an interaction I mean when the mouse goes to a certain area and the image aka the frog moves *randomly!* to another. This was quite challenging. Getting one interaction > no problem, that was quite easy. Having more, that was a hella ride. I watched probably way too many youtube tutorials on how to create arrays, how the choice function works, how to load images, and and and. I feel the code could be written way more simpler and shorter, but this is a way that worked for me in the end. Another bigger challenge I encountered in this code was to actually define the specific hover area. In the end I did it freestyle somehow, but I would like to look that more in detail maybe in another task. I also didn't figure it out how to define the hover area as not being a vertical or horizontal rectangle. As one can see, the shield the frog is holding being in the left and right side, its slightly diagonally so the area cannot be a rectangle. 
The pattern task was easier, as we discussed it in depth in class and I already got comfortable working in p5. Here my learning and favorite function right now is ✨randomness✨. It just makes everything look so natural :)
