# Task 01.02

## Question

_Think a bit about your own personal motivation to learn creative coding. What would you like to do with coding and the topics in this class? What kind of final creative coding project are you envisioning after the first session?_

I would like to learn more about OpenGL, shaders and the math behind it. I also want to explore more ways of what Creative Coding could be used for beside the obvious areas.

# Answer

### Task 01.03

**Question**  
_Find an existing creative coding project that you like. Coding needs to play a significant role for the project, also ideally it is web-based (this is not a hard requirement). Describe what you like about the project and why you think that the project represents creative coding._

I haven't really found a creative coding project (and I think the Johnny Cash Project also doesn't fit in this category), but I like this project: https://xujenna.com/NYQuotient/. It's not just a nice-looking image but a good idea. You can interact with it and your friends in a funny way and learn about opinions that New Yorkers have about things. It uses different technologies and connects them. Code is the medium but not the focus.

### Task 01.05 - The 10 PRINT pattern

I implemented the Wave Function Collapse algorithm and tried to generate an abstract human. However, it failed because the rules were too restrictive, and in the end, it's just a nice pattern. It is built using Vite, so just run `npm i` and `npm run dev`.

### Task 01.06 - Greeting Card

I created a website where users can create an account using their nicknames. After that, they get a dashboard with a link that they can share with their friends. The friends can then answer questions about that user regarding moments they shared together in the last year. On New Year's Eve at midnight, the answers get revealed for the user. It should serve as a time capsule where friends can share their memories. It is built using NextJS and Supabase. To run it locally, you would need the _Env Vars_. You can visit the website here: [Yearly Dearly](https://www.yearly-dearly.com/)

## Learnings

For the print pattern, I learned how to implement the Wave Function Collapse algorithm and also its downsides. When the rules are too restrictive, the algorithm doesn't work anymore because no rule can be applied. So for more complex scenarios, it is a bit frustrating.

For the Greeting Card, I learned how to use the framer-motion package.
