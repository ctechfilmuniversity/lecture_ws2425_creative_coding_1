# SESSION 01 

## Task 01.02

_Overall, how would you rate your skill level of programming?_
- [ ] Never done it
- [x] Novice
- [ ] Intermediate
- [ ] Advanced
- [ ] God-like

_Have you used object-oriented programming before?_
- [ ] I don't know what that is
- [ ] I know the concept, but I have never implemented it
- [x] Yes

_Overall, how would you rate your skill level of using web technologies, e.g., have you used a local server setup?_
- [ ] Never done it
- [x] Novice
- [ ] Intermediate
- [ ] Advanced
- [ ] God-like

_How would you rate your skill level of working with Git and GitHub?_
- [ ] Never done it
- [x] Novice
- [ ] Intermediate
- [ ] Advanced
- [ ] God-like

_Are there any specific topics that would interest you in the context of this lecture and that haven't been mentioned so far? If not, you can skip this question._ 
No, thank you for asking. 

_Is there anything else that you would like me to know regarding this class?  If not, you can skip this question._ 
No, thank you for asking. 

_Think a bit about your own personal motivation to learn creative coding. What would you like to do with coding and the topics in this class?_ 
I would like to learn how to work with my own videos and pictures as the base for generative art. Another topic that I like is the interaction, since I have a very strong interest in interactive and immersive Installations and the creation of experiences where the audience is absolutely necesary for the unfolding of the artwork. Moreover I want to learn different programming languages in order to gain flexibility in my career, which is already immersed in the content of the course.

_What kind of final creative coding project are you envisioning after the first session?_
I would like to create an interactive audiovisual system that is actively affected by the audience through motion sensors, cameras and microphones using physical input like voice, walking or touch. The use of multi-screen setups and non linear narratives its also part of my personal passions and would definetely be part of my project. 



## Task 01.03
_Find an existing creative coding project that you like. Coding needs to play a significant role for the project, also ideally it is web-based (this is not a hard requirement). Describe what you like about the project and why you think that the project represents creative coding._

**_"Poder Violeta"_** (violet power) is a videogame about sexual harassment on public transport in BogotÃ¡. It was made in the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana University in BogotÃ¡, Colombia. It is a research and creation project made by the Department of Design of the University,  funded by its vice-rectorate for research. _Poder Violeta_ was the result of a collaborative work with feminist groups, women and workshop participants.

The goal is to avoid and/or run away from sexual harassers in the station or on the bus. Sometimes you have some help or protection, but in general the game really makes you feel very frustrated and angry about those very unpleasant harassers. 

I really like the way this project addresses a very important topic and finds a very practical way of conveing how uncomfortable and frustrating sexual harassment is and to arise awareness about this horrible situations. _Poder Violeta_ made me uncomfortable and made me think about the need to provide safety solutions, legal consequences for harassers and accompaniment for victims, for example.

From my point of view this videogame represents creative coding for me because it goes beyond the practical uses of the design or videogames. It is not about making money with a game that people enjoy playing, but rather to use the means of gamification and programming and put them at the service of social problems of the cities, in order to inform, raise awareness and hopefully create solutions. 

Here is a short **video** about the proyect _(make sure to activate the automatic subtitles in english or in the language of your preference in case you do not speak spanish)_:

And [this is the link ](https://apps.apple.com/co/app/poder-violeta-2/id1373053908) of the apple store, in case you want to play. Unfortunately I could not find the game in the playstore for AndroidðŸ˜¢

## Learnings

_Please summarize your personal learnings. What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?_

It is definetely very important to think about the potential of the creativity when coding and I am pretty sure we are walking towards something very challenging and important to build the interdisciplinarity that our world needs. 
I remembered/learned again about the syntax needed to work in p5. It was very similar to Processing and I learned that p5 is actually made by the Processing Foundation. 

For the exercise I worked with color, randomness and got comfortable using basic functions like fill(), stroke() and noStroke(). I wanted to create something that would feel alive and that it would flicker like the light of a reflection. I knew I needed to find a way of working with the transparenci of the colors and to find a balance between geometry, change and speed. I want to keep learning and discovering ways of making it more interactive, to control better the placement of the colors and start creating my own variables, but I am very happy and proud with this first result. I could watch this for a very long time. 


For the second one I tryied to explore the idea of a dark space, where it is possible to "light up" the words with the help of the mouse, since the message of the card is that the reader can feel my love, even if they cannot see me. I want to continue working on this, this was very challenging and a little bit overwhelming, but I think I will make it work soon.
