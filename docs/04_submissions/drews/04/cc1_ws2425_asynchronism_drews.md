## Session 04 - Asynchronism / Space Again (15 points)  

### Task 04.02 - Coding Practices  
Reflect on your usage of resources and Machine Learning tools for coding.  

- What have you used and how has it served you?  

I used chat gpt and it really helped me both understand the Three.js documentation. It also helped me understand some of the new terms and concepts I tried to implement from tutorials and helped me adapt the ideas that I saw in tutorials into the scene I was creating. Lastly, it helped me do things more efficiently. Often times I would write a function that worked but had a few faults and chat gpt helped me find those errors and improve them. It also introduced me to new, more nieche things catered to what I was doing which I probably would not have found in any tutorial. 

- Do you actually understand the code an ML tool has given to you (in case you have used any)?  

Yes, most definitely. Since I mainly used it to improve and make my code more concise, I think it helped give my code and overall logic that would have taken me much longer to achieve had I not had chat gpt. It also really helped in terms of naming which I think added to the overall readability of my code. That being said, I think it was mainly understandable since I do have some knowledge in coding so I have the basic knowledge on what everything ‘should’ look like. 

- Would you be able to re-create it without any help?  

No, I would not have been able to achieve such a complex scene for my ability in the amount of time that I was able to make this. Even though I have some knowledge in coding, I am completely new to Three.js and found that chat gpt helped me find things that would have taken me much longer to get to. For example, there is something called an AnimationMixer that chat gpt showed me which helps you control your animations. Without knowing how to implement this easily I would have probably just had stationary zombies in a forrest which was my initial idea.

- What can you recommend?  

Well, since I only really used chat gpt, I would recommend using it. I think it might even be better to go the ‘long’ route and use chat gpt rather than Co Pilot since I think it is important to first try and understand what you are doing and implement it as far as you can go and only use AI to make it better. I think that having Co Pilot right there in the coding process might have resulted in me not trying to solve my own problems first.

- How do you want to proceed?  

I think just as I have used it in this project. I think I was able to learn new things that I probably wouldn’t have had the time to had I not used chat gpt. Instead of just learning how to load a FBX model into my scene, I learnt how to add different animations and how that works.

**Submission:** _Just a couple of bullet points are sufficient._
