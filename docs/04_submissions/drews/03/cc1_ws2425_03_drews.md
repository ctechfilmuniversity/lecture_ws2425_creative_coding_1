# Learnings

The most challenging part of this exercise for me was understanding how the Three.js documentation is structured. At first, everything seemed straightforward, but I quickly realized that grasping how the documentation explains concepts took some time and was a bit confusing. Now, I feel like I have a better understanding, but I still have a lot to learn. I plan to watch more videos and dive deeper into the material. I followed a tutorial that showed me how to move spheres, which helped me get a better grasp of moving objects in Three.js, so I'll keep looking for similar resources as I feel these are easier to understand for a complete newbie.
