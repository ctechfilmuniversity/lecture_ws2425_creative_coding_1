# SESSION 3
_**David Leonardo PirazÃ¡n Palomar**_

## Task 03.01 - Pre_setup
- [x] Install node, nvm and npm
- [x] Verify a correct installation with executing node -v and npm -v in the terminal

## Task 03.02 - Local Project Setup
- [x] Proper local installation.

## Task 03.03 - Your First Scene
**_Build a three dimensional, geometric scene. With geometric I mean that the scene should focus on abstract geometry - also think sculptural. Remember: exceptional creativity often emerges out of constraints and refrainment ðŸ˜Ž_**

When looking at the art works, that were meant to inspire us I thought of the feeling of being immersed in a geometric space with lights, color and dynamism. Where forms would be like empty planets that I can inhabit inside and outside them. Each of these "planets" of this "constellation" would have their own rhythm and direction. I wanted the lights to play with the colors of the forms and to create an appealing dynamic that is nice to look at and to be immersed in. 

These are my answers to the proposed questions:
- **_How to translate the above 2D concepts and aesthetics into 3D space?_**  I definitely thought of light and the type of materials of my objects. The gradients of the paintings made me think about the gradients and shadows that can be generated with different light sources, their position and intensity. 

- **_How to give the above abstractions an 3D embodiment?_**
The 2D dimension of the art works is from my point of view an invitation to watch those abstraction from other points of view. By turning around the objects and creating ways of seing the body of those objects emerges. 

- **_How to merge 2D and 3D?_** In this particular case I discover that this is possible with the use of light and movement of the geometry. Sometimes those objects look like plane surfaces, and some seconds later they show its depth. 

- **_How about using time as an creative tool? Could there be movement?_** Totally, the movement is central in this idea of exploring other points of view and ways of perceiving the forms.

**Note:** I am not sure if the "required source files" are the HTML or the scene.js in this case. If I understood correctly the package.json is the only file we share, right?

Just in case I got that wrong here are the HTML and the scene.js files:

## Learnings
_**Please summarize your personal learnings. What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?**_

This is my first experience with three.js, it has been very important for me to have a better understanding of the way graphics programming works. I learned how to set up my computer to be able to create this 3D spaces with the package managers and the basic workflow in order to create a scene. 

It was challenging to have a very "raw" coding experience in comparison to p5. The way it works is way more complex and for getting the hang of it, it is important to practice, learn and apply. 

I challenged myself by creating complex structures based on the documentation and the scene example we got from Lena. I played with the basic forms and molded them as parts of my dynamic sculpture. I also wanted to create different temporalities and scales so I watched some videos on how to create different geometries without having problems with the "duplicated" names of the variables, because I had that issue. Luckily I solved that situation. However, the hardest part was definitely the camera, light and shadow parameters of the scene. I am very happy with my final result, but I am still learning and I want to be more conscious and understand better  how I got where I got through experimentation.
