# SESSION 4
_**David Leonardo Piraz√°n Palomar**_

## Task 04.01
**_Re-cap the sections in the script regarding higher order functions and their different syntax formats._**
- [x] Higher Order Functions
- [x] Anonymous Functions
- [x] Arrow Functions
- [x] Asynchronism


## Task 04.02 - Coding Practices
_**Reflect on your usage of resources and Machine Learning tools for coding.**_

- **_What have you used and how has it served you?_**
    I have used the tools of p5 and three js with the help of the Javascript language, libraries and the deep connection of this elements with CSS and HTML in order to create visual art works. Regarding the Machine Learning part I have only used CHat GPT to understand better what I was doing with my scene for this assignment, after trying everything and being frustrated. 

- **_Do you actually understand the code an ML tool has given to you (in case you have used any)?_**
    
    Yes, I was able to understand and I even asked it for explanation so I could be conscious about it. 

- **_Would you be able to re-create it without any help?_**
    Definitely, I think the ML tools can be specific enough in order to conserve the agency and not depend all the time on it. 

- **_What can you recommend?_**
    Try first with what you already know!, read the documentation, watch tutorials if it is not clear yet and compare different sources if you are not sure. If after all this it is not clear go for the ML tool and make sure to ask it to explain you where your mistakes where. 

- **_How do you want to proceed?_**
    I want to keep on learning, applying and experimenting with what I already know and ask for helps to humans or ML tools in order to expand my knowledge and to create art works making the most of the new tools.


## Task 04.03 - Your Own Scene
_**Create a Three.js scene up to your liking. There are no constraints for what the scene should be. The result should be polished and will be graded on concept, form / design and implementation quality. You are required to use additional functionality that you haven't yet used last week. Check the three.js manual or the examples for inspiration.**_

I created this virtual installation called _"Blink reflex"_. It is a landscape where a sphere and 2 rings are floating centered. While the reflections on the sphere are always there, the reflections on the rings disappear from specific points of view. This idea of an impossible installation, where the reflecting forms and materials float and can be invisible from other parts of the landscape is an invitation to reflect about the importance of exploring different points of view, to see beyond the possible in order to see the impossible and to see beyond the visible in order to see the invisible. 

Here is a picture of the installation:

## Learnings

_**Please summarize your personal learnings. What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?**_

This project was very important for me because I was able to create my first impossible installation. I wanted to create an project  where the audience has an encounter with the alien, with what disrupts the everyday landscape and hints at a new or different dynamic in familiar spaces such as parks. It was very challenging to load the HDRI to my project and used it for the background and for the geometries. I learned how to do this without lights. I challenge myself by creating something that I have never done. I wanted both rings to rotate, but every time I did something to make it work on the look the screen went white. However, I am very happy with the result and I want to keep creating this impossible installations making the most of this new tools.
