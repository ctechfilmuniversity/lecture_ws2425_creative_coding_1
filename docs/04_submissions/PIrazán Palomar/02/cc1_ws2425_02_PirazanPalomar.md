## Task 02.03 - Algorithmic Thinking
_**Briefly reflect on how you implemented your creative idea. Did you apply algorithmic thinking and if so, how?**_
- **Circles:**  For this first task I wanted everything to be made of circles. In contrast to the "Happiness" task, I discovered what I wanted to do creating different circles with different sizes, colors and alpha values. After thatI found some qualities of the pictures that I liked and I decided to create "layers" that would "compilate" those findings and make it more complex and interactive. After rationalizing what I did by feeling and experimentation, I came up with this 3 algorithmic steps:
    - Create a dynamic b/w circle background. 
    - Create a pattern of circles. 
    - Make the color of the pattern change when mouse is pressed. 

    I can say that the algorithmic thinking was complimenting well with my creative thinking. It helped me organize my ideas and know what to do next. However, the creative thinking was also giving feedback to my algorithmic thinking. I can understand why both are very important. 

    

- **Happiness:**  My biggest happiness is to have the opportunity of loving and being loved, so I want to create an artwork where there is a main figure, which is always surrounded by other figures, even when the former takes distance from the latter, or even if the former changes its form or color. Hence, I would show that love is an indelible connection between beings beyond the change processes of the beings or the circumstances.  
 
    I took my idea and translated it into a more algorithmic language: Create a main figure with some "helper" figures around. Everytime the main figure changes its position the helpers come "to the rescue" and "are there" for the main figure. If someone clicks, the main figure would change its form bit that it's not important for the "helpers", since they also change and the "care" is present everytime. 

    - Create a main figure with a starting form and color. 
    - Attach the figure to the mouseX and mouseY.
    - Make the main figure vibrates, to make it alive.
    - Make the form and color change with the clicks
    - Create "helpers"
    - Make the helpers vibrate, to make them alive. 
    - Make the helpers change form.
    - Create an "attraction" between the main figure and the "helpers".

    At the end I was not able to change the form, so I just made circles and changed the color. I would love to see how I could change the form randomly and also make a class of triangles, I have the feeling it can be made with arrays, but I am not there yet. 
    
    After trying, the simplification of my idea is that the touch of both the helpers and the main figure has a change on the main figure. However, I do not know yet how to indicate the position of the objects of my class, so the main figure can change when being in touch with them. 


## Task 02.04 - Creative Instructions
_**Write instructions that are in themselves a creative output.**_

Roll a dice, look at the number you got and go to sleep. The number you get is the number of hours your dream will last. Dream that you are watching a computer and you are a geometrical form that gets bigger and bigger than the screen. Jump inside that form and swim. Do not fear, this is your own form, it can be an ocean, a lake or a river. Find the shore and adjust the temperature of the water, take into account that that will also be the temperature outside the water too. Look up and float to the arms of your loved ones. Deep breaths, relax and wake up. 




## Task 02.05 - Working With a Local Server
**The Web. Re-capture Script 06 - The Web.**

- [x] Create a setup with a local webserver and be able to work with, e.g., p5, locally.





## Learnings
_**Please summarize your personal learnings. What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?**_

The algorithmic thinking is very complementary to the creative thinking. There are many ways of creating an artwork and I have identified, that my starting point is sometimes the former, sometimes the latter, but both are definitely tools that must be trained and conjugated when doing creative coding. I believe it is also important to ise the algorithmic thinking to organize and share ideas with others, so they are not abstract concepts that are only clear for the person with the idea. Specially when working with a team. 

I have been learning more about p5 with the help of tutorials. I have been learning about functions and classes. That is definitely the hardest part, since I am still learning how to integrate the new knowledge in my projects. However, that is the way I wanted to challenge myself. For the second task of this session I worked with classes without arguments, but I would like to try it in the next exercises. Moreover, as mentioned before, I would like to learn how to change randomly the form of a figure and also to make a class for triangles, because I was not able to crate the condition of the touch between the objects of the class I created and my main figure, so the main figure can change when being together with the "helpers."
